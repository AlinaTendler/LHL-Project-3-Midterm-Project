# Data Science Midterm Project

## Project/Goals
This midterm project uses a comprehensive property market dataset to predict property sale prices. The objective is to build a machine learning pipeline—from exploratory analysis through baseline modeling and hyperparameter tuning—to provide accurate and actionable insights for real estate stakeholders.
## Process
### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 - Data Quality and Cleaning: The dataset for missing values and outliers was examined, applying necessary cleaning procedures.
 - Feature Distribution & Correlations: Visualized the distributions of property attributes (e.g., property size, number of rooms, location attributes) and computed correlation matrices to identify influential factors.
 - Key Insights: Identified trends such as the strong impact of geographic location and property condition on the sale price, guiding further feature selection for modeling.

### 2. Modeling Pipeline
 - Preprocessing: Built a robust preprocessing pipeline that handles numerical scaling and categorical encoding to ensure data consistency.
 - Baseline Models: Implemented multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to establish performance baselines.
 - Performance Evaluation: Used cross-validation and metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R² to evaluate and compare model performances, ensuring reliable predictions on unseen data.

### 3. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Optimization Techniques: Leveraged GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to fine-tune model hyperparameters, especially for ensemble methods such as XGBoost and Gradient Boosting.
- Model Refinement: Focused on balancing model complexity with interpretability, achieving improved performance, and reducing prediction errors on the test set.
- Final Model Selection: The tuned model, selected based on cross-validated performance metrics, demonstrated strong predictive ability while highlighting the most significant property features.

## Results

- Best Model: The final tuned model (e.g., an optimized XGBoost Regressor) shows robust performance in predicting property sale prices.
- Performance Metrics:
   - RMSE: ~27,000 (placeholder – update with actual values)
   - R² Score: ~0.87 (placeholder – update with actual values)

- Insights: The analysis revealed that property location, size, and condition are the most significant predictors. While the model performs well for most properties, forecasting prices for high-end or atypical properties remains challenging.

## Challenges

 - Data Quality: Handling missing values and ensuring consistency in categorical fields, particularly regarding location data, was a key challenge.
 - Feature Engineering: Iteratively identifying the right features without overfitting required careful analysis and domain knowledge.
 - Model Complexity vs. Interpretability: Balancing advanced ensemble methods with the need for model interpretability and actionable insights was essential.

## Future Work

 - Deployment: Develop a web-based dashboard using Flask or Streamlit to provide real-time property price predictions.
 - Enhanced Feature Engineering: Integrate geospatial features and external data (e.g., neighborhood statistics) to further improve model accuracy.
 - Advanced Modeling: Experiment with additional ensemble techniques or neural networks and incorporate interpretability tools such as SHAP or LIME to explain model decisions.
 - Continuous Improvement: Refine the data preprocessing and feature selection processes based on feedback from domain experts and further data exploration.
